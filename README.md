â€”Brain tumor detection and segmentation are critical
tasks in medical imaging that directly impact clinical decisionmaking and treatment outcomes. Traditional machine learning
and CNN-based models have seen considerable success but still
face challenges such as capturing complex high-dimensional
patterns and achieving computational efficiency. This report
proposes a two-stage brain tumor analysis system using Quantum
Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN) for tumor detection and
a 3D CNN-enhanced U-Net for precise segmentation. We provide
an in-depth discussion of system architecture, explain the advantages of QCNN over classical CNNs, describe hyperparameter
tuning strategies for U-Net, and detail comprehensive dataset
preparation methods utilizing the BraTS dataset. Our results
demonstrate a detection accuracy of 96% and a segmentation
Dice score of 0.91, showcasing the promising potential of combining quantum machine learning techniques with deep learning
for medical imaging.
